Welcome to the cellular automata terminal interface.
————
These are some usable commands:

createProgram <programName> <automata>
createBox <programName> <boxName> <cellsX> <cellsY>
run <programName> <boxName> <numberOfTicks>
save <programName> <boxName>
load <programName> <boxName>
exit

These commands are in development:

welcome (displays this message)
help (massive page about possible automata, basically docs)

If you are unsure what to do, try typing the commands in order. "programs" are held within "boxes", so make sure to run both create commands first

Please specify a command now.
