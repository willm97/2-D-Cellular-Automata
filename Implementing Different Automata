Here's a Wolfram paper about 2-D automata that might be useful for some purpose, like using enumerations. It at least mentions them.

I'll implement rule 736 here soon I think - it's a variant of life (224?) and may be high life.
rule 224 - Conway's Game of Life
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f g h
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Totalistic rule - even bits are for dead cells, odd bits for live cells, and the count increases with the number of bits. Probably not how I would have done it (I would have just reversed the order) but it seems legit enough.
So rule 736 is 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f g h
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Which means it's life, but it keeps a cell alive if it has four neighbors and is alive. This isn't highlife but it's interesting. It grows outward indefinitely for many initial conditions.

Using a von Neumann five-neighbor square neighborhood, outer totalistic rules look like:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
x x x x x x x x x x

For instance, 374: (ruleVT374
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0

rule 614 (sum modulo two)
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
